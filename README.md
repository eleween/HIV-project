# Notes on writing
## Thoughts on contribution and positioning
- When discussing firm's value capture we have two approaches. One (Adner and Kapoor; Ethiraj) focuses on the firm's value capture as a function of the value creation by the ecosystem; competition is not taken into account. The other is by Jacobides, which takes into account competition.

### Comparing literature streams
Modular architecture and industry architecture get closer to the mechanisms of value creation and value capture in contexts with complementary products, in large part thanks to fine-grained context that they generally use, with interdependencies defined by technology. This allows to test the mechanisms. The second important contribution, especially of the industry architecture literature, is the notion of bottleneck which incorporates the ideas of competition by the actor and for the actor from value-based strategy. 
At the same time, the ecosystems literature was crucial to broaden the spectrum of the contexts amenable for research on compleemnts beyond computer sector; the interdependencies do not necessarily have to be technological compatibility. Secondly, Adner and Kapoor (2010) popularized the notion of complements for broader strategy literature.
