# Notes on writing
## Thoughts on contribution and positioning
- When discussing firm's value capture we have two approaches. One (Adner and Kapoor; Ethiraj) focuses on the firm's value capture as a function of the value creation by the ecosystem; competition is not taken into account. The other is by Jacobides, which takes into account competition.

### Comparing literature streams
Modular architecture and industry architecture get closer to the mechanisms of value creation and value capture in contexts with complementary products, in large part thanks to fine-grained context that they generally use, with interdependencies defined by technology. This allows to test the mechanisms. The second important contribution, especially of the industry architecture literature, is the notion of bottleneck which incorporates the ideas of competition by the actor and for the actor from value-based strategy. 

At the same time, the ecosystems literature was crucial to broaden the spectrum of the contexts amenable for research on compleemnts beyond computer sector; the interdependencies do not necessarily have to be technological compatibility. Secondly, Adner and Kapoor (2010) popularized the notion of complements for broader strategy literature. 

## Literature streams:
*Literature on complements - 3 streams*
- Ecosystem (Adner & Kapoor)
- Innovation in complex systems (Ethiraj)
- Industry architecture (Jacobides)

*Value-based strategy*

Value-based strategy (Brandenburger and Stuart, 1996) that deals with value creation and value capture in coalitions of players is particularly well-suited to analyze the contexts with complementary products. In fact, it was invoked by the early literature in both ecosystems (Adner and Kapoor, 2010) and industry architecture streams (Jacobides, Knudsen, and Augier, 2006), yet the later research in both streams does not mention or build on value-based tradition.  

[We need a part discussing VBS relevance, and how our work corresponds to it - or maybe it should be the contribution?]

Value-based strategy uses cooperative game theory to explore how value is created by a set of actors and how this value is split among actors. Its core concepts are value creation, added value and value capture. Added value is .... Actor's aded value is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for value capture by an actor. The seminal paper by Brandenburger and Stuart (1996) laid the foundation while later works by Lippman and Rumelt (2003) and MacDonald and Ryall (2004) further adapted its language and implications for strategy research. Brandenburger and Stuart (2007) furthered VBS relevance for strategy research by combining cooperative and non-cooperative game theory into a two-stage game allowing to see the implications of firm's strategic actions for value creation and value capture.
