## Thoughts on contribution and positioning
- When discussing firm's value capture we have two approaches. One (Adner and Kapoor; Ethiraj) focuses on the firm's value capture as a function of the value creation by the ecosystem; competition is not taken into account. The other is by Jacobides, which takes into account competition.

## Introduction
What are the main points?

Contexts with complementary products raise interesting questions about how value is created and how it is split, because of interdependencies between component performance, and tensions between value creation and value capture incentives. 
These questions have been tackled by three literature streams, two focusing predominantly on value creation, and the third on on value capture aspect. 
Strategy literature with ecosystem perspective established that the availability of complements is crucial to enable firms to create value with their products, especially in the context of new technology adoption (Adner and Kapoor, 2010). Technology perspective grounded in complex systems (Simon, 1962) and modularity (Baldwin and Clark, 2000) highlights challenges for value creation that emerge in such contexts due to interdependencies in performance: not only complements have to be available, but their performance also has to match the requirements of the focal product (Ethiraj, 2007).   
Finally, industry architecture literature, also building on modularity in design (Baldwin and Clark, 2000), shifts the discussion to how the value created is distributed across the ecosystem components, in particular emphasizing the importance of becoming a so-called bottleneck component: the ``the part of the firms’ or the industry’s system that is in most scarce supply"  

- bring together value creation and value capture considerations
- The gap is in heterogeneity among players within


### Comparing literature streams
Modular architecture and industry architecture get closer to the mechanisms of value creation and value capture in contexts with complementary products, in large part thanks to fine-grained context that they generally use, with interdependencies defined by technology. This allows to test the mechanisms. The second important contribution, especially of the industry architecture literature, is the notion of bottleneck which incorporates the ideas of competition by the actor and for the actor from value-based strategy. 

At the same time, the ecosystems literature was crucial to broaden the spectrum of the contexts amenable for research on compleemnts beyond computer sector; the interdependencies do not necessarily have to be technological compatibility. Secondly, Adner and Kapoor (2010) popularized the notion of complements for broader strategy literature. 

## Literature streams:
*Literature on complements - 3 streams*
- Ecosystem (Adner & Kapoor)
- Innovation in complex systems (Ethiraj)
- Industry architecture (Jacobides)

*Ecosystems - main points*

- The main contribution: "widen the lens": from supply chain to a broader ecosystem that includes complements in the value chain
- In particular, how accounting for the complements alters the way we interpret industry evolution (aka adoption of new technology, substitution of the old technology by the new)
- consequently, concentrates on the availability of complements as the main IV. In later work it becomes a DV (Kapoor, 2013 - Advances in Strategic Management), somewhat in Kapoor \& Lee (2013) (hospitals). The main mechanism is the impact of the complements on value-creating capabilities of the focal product: constraining (Adner and Kapoor, 2010), but also enabling (Adner and Kapoor, 2016). 
- While the IV is generally the availability of complements, DVs vary from technology adoption (Adner and Kapoor, 2016) to firm's profitability (Adner and Kapoor, 2010; Kapoor and Lee, 2013) to firm's strategic choice (Kapoor and Furr, 2015). 
- However, don't take into account competition by complements and for complements
- complements supply is exogenous: firms cannot directly affect it (partially due to the constraints imposed by the empirical settings where capabilities for the focal product and complementary product are vastly different); complements are not strategizing (in that they do not react to the product in the focal component).

*Innovation in complex systems - main points*

- The main contribution is that while modularity in design confers advatange in terms of parallel innovation (Baldwin and Clark, 2000), there is a dark side: due to interdependencies between components innovation in one component may constrain the performance of another component, sometimes to the extent that it prevents the whole system from creating value (Ethiraj and Levinthal, 2004), which may incentivize firms other than those in the constraint component to invest in resolving this constraint (Ethiraj, 2007). The important contribution is when firms have more incentives to invest into the constraint component 
- heterogeneity in terms of sunk R&D investment results in heterogeneity in incentives to invest in constraint component (Ethiraj, 2007). Furthermore, in Ethiraj and Posen (2013) the value capture aspect is considered as the asymmetries in dependence of the focal component and on the focal component and subsequent ability to benefit from the innovation affect the innovation effort of the firms in the focal component. The latter paper, in fact, incorporates logic of the industry architecture stream. 
- However, the focus is on value creation, not on value capture. 
- the impact of dependence is assumed to be the same for all firms within the component 


*IA - main points*

- The main contribution: given the joint value creation by a bundle of complements, opened the discussion on how to appropriate value in a complex system/modular system/ ecosystem; that firms can adopt strategies to achieve a privileged position within the system that allows it to enjoy higher value capture. 
- key question: who benefits from the innovation
- Bottleneck is no longer only a constraint on value creation - it is also a point of value capture. From Ethiraj (bottleneck is a constraint, which ahs to be resolved) to strategic bottleneck: a part of value chain in most scarce supply which enables the entity controlling it to appropriate a higher share of value
- However, the level fo analysis is component; don't consider value capture by an individual firm. As such, the heterogeneity is only between components, but not within components.  


*Value-based strategy*

Value-based strategy (Brandenburger and Stuart, 1996) that deals with value creation and value capture in coalitions of players is particularly well-suited to analyze the contexts with complementary products. In fact, it was invoked by the early literature in both ecosystems (Adner and Kapoor, 2010) and industry architecture streams (Jacobides, Knudsen, and Augier, 2006), yet the later research in both streams does not mention or build on value-based tradition.  

[We need a part discussing VBS relevance, and how our work corresponds to it - or maybe it should be the contribution?]

Value-based strategy uses cooperative game theory to explore how value is created by a set of actors and how this value is split among actors. Its core concepts are value creation, added value and value capture. Added value is .... Actor's aded value is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for value capture by an actor. The seminal paper by Brandenburger and Stuart (1996) laid the foundation while later works by Lippman and Rumelt (2003) and MacDonald and Ryall (2004) further adapted its language and implications for strategy research. Brandenburger and Stuart (2007) furthered VBS relevance for strategy research by combining cooperative and non-cooperative game theory into a two-stage game allowing to see the implications of firm's strategic actions for value creation and value capture.
